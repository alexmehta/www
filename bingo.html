    <h3>Reflection Stuff</h3>
    My favorite experience was the research activity because it was something I already wanted to do before bingo. I enjoy learning about how complex things work in simple ways, and it was very self guided unlike the how it's made video option. 
    On the surface level, I gained more understanding of how generative language models work. In a deeper sense, the activity helped me understand how to explain complex topics from various sources into an easier to understand summary for the average reader.
